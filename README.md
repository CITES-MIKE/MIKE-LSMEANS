This repository contains the R script used to analyse data from the [Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) Programme](https://www.cites.org/eng/prog/mike/index.php). MIKE is a site-based system designed to monitor trends in the illegal killing of elephants, build management capacity and provide information to help range States make appropriate management and enforcement decisions.

MIKE evaluates relative poaching levels based on the Proportion of Illegally Killed Elephants (PIKE), which is calculated as the number of illegally killed elephants found divided by the total number of elephant carcasses encountered by patrols or other means, aggregated by year for each site. 

The file with the R code can be downloaded from subdirectory RCODE. It details the MIKE analytical method used to determine PIKE trends for Africa and its subregions and for Asia.

The R Markdown document contains chunks of embedded R code used for the PIKE analysis. The document also provides a step-by-step guide on how to run the R code; in addition, it provides background to the MIKE programme, MIKE data and  PIKE. Finally, the content of the R Markdown document can be viewed as a PDF document (see XXXX.pdf).
